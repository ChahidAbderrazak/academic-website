Together with Prof. Khalid Elgazzar and my advisor  Prof. Hossam A. Gabbar,  we have been awarded the Highway Infrastructure Innovations Funding Program (HIIFP) from the Ministry Of Transportation of Ontario (MTO). The one year project was funded (126K CAD).

In this project, we propose to to build a new generation of smart and digital highways enabling real-time road condition and traffic inspection for  vehicle driving assistance.
