I am a data scientist with expertise defect detection and prediction. I got my Ph.D. in signal processing-based feature extraction (see [my thesis](https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/items/c98714c0-bbbb-4fd7-a9d9-e65d47328825)).
I  worked on [different research and industrial projects](https://chahid-abderrazak.com/#projects) related to signal/image processing, computer vision, feature extraction, optimization, and statistical modeling.
