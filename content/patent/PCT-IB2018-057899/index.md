# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We developed a signal reconstruction method, called SCSA, for pulse-shaped signal decomposition. After the decomposition, the reconstructioned signal will be composed of weighted sum of squared eigen-functions waveform of the Schrodinger operator.  This method can also be used for signal denoising.

The SCSA method can be used pulse-shaped signals such as magnetic resonance spectra (MRS) signals. It is used for suppressing the water line in an acquired MRS signal <i>y</i>, the method including receiving the acquired MRS spectra <i>y</i>; estimating a water peak <i>y<sub>wp</sub></i> for the acquired MRS spectra <i>y</i> using squared eigenfunctions ( <span>&#632;</span>)
   of a Schrodinger operator   <b> H </b> ; and removing the water peak <i>y<sub>wp</sub></i> from the acquired MRS <i>y</i>, to obtain a suppressed water MRS spectra <i>y<sub>ws</sub></i>. The suppressed water MRS spectra <i>y<sub>ws</sub></i> include a signature of one or more metabolites.

The research reported in this patent was supported by King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in collaboration with GENT University (Belgium).
