A method for generating a feature associated with input data includes receiving the input data; projecting the input data with a set of square functions ( <span>&#632;</span> <sub>nh2</sub> <sup>2</sup>) of the Schrödinger operator; selecting the feature to be a number of the negative eigenvalues λnh of the Schrödinger operator; and classifying the input data based on the feature
