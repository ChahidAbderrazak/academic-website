abstract: A method for suppressing a water line in an acquired magnetic resonance spectra (MRS) y, the method including receiving (800) the acquired MRS spectra y; estimating (802) a water peak ywp for the acquired MRS spectra y using squared eigenfunctions (Ïˆ) of a Schrodinger operator H; and removing (804) the water peak ywp from the acquired MRS y to obtain a suppressed water MRS spectra yws. The suppressed water MRS spectra yws includes a signature of one or more metabolites.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We developed a Feature Extraction method, called QuPWM, for epileptic spikes detection in MEG signals.  This method is based on combining the position weight matrix (PWM) method with digital quantization.
