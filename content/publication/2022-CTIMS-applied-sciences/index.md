abstract: Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) is one of the inspection techniques used in industrial tool inspection for quality and safety control. It is performed mainly using X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) to scan the internal structure of the tools and detect the potential defects. In this paper, we propose a new toolbox called the CT-Based Integrity Monitoring System (CTIMS-Toolbox) for automated inspection of CT images and volumes. It contains three main modules. First, the database management module, which handles the database and reads/writes queries to retrieve or save the CT data. Second, the pre-processing module for registration and background subtraction. Third, the defect inspection module to detect all the potential defects (missing parts, damaged screws, etc.) based on a hybrid system composed of computer vision and deep learning techniques. This paper explores the different features of the CTIMS-Toolbox, exposes the performance of its modules, compares its features to some existing CT inspection toolboxes, and provides some examples of the obtained results.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We developed hybrid model for automated defect inspection using a combination of  image processing and deep learning models.
