abstract: A smart city is a trending concept describing a new generation of cities operated intelligently with minimal human intervention. It promotes energy sustainability, minimal environmental impact, and better governance. In transportation, the remote highway infrastructure monitoring will enhance the driverâ€™s safety, continuously report road conditions, and identify potential hazardous incidents such as accidents, floods, or snow storms. In addition, it facilitates the integration of future cuttingedge technologies such as self-driving vehicles. This paper presents a general introduction to a smart monitoring system for automated real-time road condition inspection. The proposed solution includes hardware devices/nodes and software applications for data processing, road condition inspection using hybrid algorithms based on digital signal processing, and artificial intelligence technologies. The proposed system has an interactive web interface for real-time data sharing, infrastructure monitoring, visualization, and management of inspection reports which can improve the maintenance process.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We designed amnd implemened a datalogger to screen the road using camera and vibrations sensors. The collected data is used to train deep leargning models for defect road inspection  model for automated defect inspection using a combination of  image processing and deep learning models.
