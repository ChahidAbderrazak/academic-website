abstract: Water suppression, in proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) using post-processing techniques, is very challenging due to the large amplitude of the water line, which shadows the metabolic peaks with small amplitudes and complicates their quantification. In addition, the peak-shaped structure of these spectra and the relatively small number of data points representing them makes the suppression process more cumbersome. In this paper, a post-processing water suppression technique based on the Schrodinger operator is proposed. The method is based on the decomposition of the input MRS spectrum, using the squared eigenfunctions of a semi-classical Schrodinger operator.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
