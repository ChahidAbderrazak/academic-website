In order to improve the biomedical signal quality, we designed different algorithms based on a quantum method called Semi-Classical Signal Analysis (SCSA) [1]. This method has the ability to decompose the input signal/image into a set of components based on the Eigen-spectrum of the Schrödinger operator.  


We targeted different biomedical applications:

1. MRI image enhancement using adaptive algorithm based on image segmentation
2. MRS residual water suppression using the squared eigenfunctions of the Schrödinger operator
3. Complex MRS signal denoising using SCSA-based  soft thresholding.

This work was under the supervision of professor Meriem laleg (KAUST).
