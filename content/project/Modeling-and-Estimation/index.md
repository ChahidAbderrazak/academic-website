Since its official identification in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started to spread globally, resulting in an ongoing pandemic. In this work, we try to investigate how mathematical, statistical and data-driven models of the COVID-19 to understand factors promoting virus spread.

This work was in collaboration with Mohamed A. Bahloul. Our proposed AI models focuses on the following points:

1. Propose a generalized epidemic model based on fractional modeling
2. understand the main factor which can slow down the spread
3. Apply control technique to assist the government in their decision making process.

This work was in collaboration with Mohamed A. Bahloul under the supervision of professor Meriem laleg (KAUST).
