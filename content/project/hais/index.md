In our research, we propose a smart monitoring system for automated and real-time road condition inspection. The system includes

{{< figure library="true" src="hais-framework.jpeg" title="The HAIS inspection framework." lightbox="true" >}}

Three main components:

1. Hardware devices/nodes: for data collection using drones or a designed node that can be mounted on vehicles.
2. Software applications: for data preparation, and road condition inspection using hybrid algorithms based on digital signal processing, and Artificial Intelligence technologies.
3. Webapp: is an interactive web interface for real-time data sharing, infrastructure monitoring, visualization, and management of inspection reports which can improve the maintenance process.

This project was led by Prof. [Hossam A. Gabbar](https://hossamgaber.com/) and Prof. [Khalid Elgazzar](https://ontariotechu.ca/experts/feas/khalid-elgazzar.php) and me as the postdoctoral researcher of the team in collaboration with [Ministry of Transportation of Ontario ](https://www.ontario.ca/page/ministry-transportation).
