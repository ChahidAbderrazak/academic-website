In our research, we propose a smart diagnostic module (ToothAI) that can be integrated into existing dental software. This module is based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows the diagnosis of X-ray images/volumes and helps in the early detection and diagnosis of oral health diseases.

{{< figure library="true" src="tooth-ai-framework.jpeg" title="The ToothAI module framework." lightbox="true" >}}

The solution presents a smart and automated assistive platform to aid dental practitioners in identifying underlying tooth diseases and accessing doctors in treatment suggestions.

This project was led by Prof. [Hossam A. Gabbar](https://hossamgaber.com/) and me as the postdoctoral researcher of the team (composed of two master's students [[Oluwabukola Grace](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oluwabukolaadegboro/), [Md Jamiul Alam Khan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamiul/)], software developer [Matthew Immanuel Samson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-immanuel-samson-094b56158/)).

For a demo or more details, please contact professor Hossam A. Gabbar (Hossam.Gaber@ontariotechu.ca )
