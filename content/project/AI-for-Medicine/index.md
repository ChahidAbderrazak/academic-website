In our research, we focus on investigating the use of signal processing tools for biomedical diagnosis.


Biomedical Signal/Image  quality enhancement
In order to improve the biomedical signal quality, we designed different algorithms based on a quantum method called Semi-Classical Signal Analysis (SCSA). This method has the ability to decompose the input signal/image into a set of components based on the Eigen-spectrum of the Schrödinger operator.  

We targeted different biomedical applications:

MRI image enhancement using adaptive algorithm based on image segmentation
MRS residual water suppression using the squared eigenfunctions of the Schrödinger operator
Complex MRS signal denoising using SCSA-based  soft thresholding.
Biomedical Signal/Image classification
In order to assist neurologist and biologist during their daily activity and save the time spent in the manual processing of the records, we need focus on building efficient machine learning models based on the extraction of pertinent and discriminative features for the prediction of biomedical signals. Our models are based on:

Using Digital Signal Processing (DSP) features
Improving the raw data quality and reducing feature vector size
Improving the classifier robustness or sensitivity to noise.
In our different studies, we targeted the following aspects:

Assist biologists in defining accurately the Poly(A) locations in the DNA sequence
Assist clinicians in detecting spiky region in the brain using MEG/EEG/ECG signals epileptic  diagnosis
Predicting human cognitive tasks from their corresponding functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data.
